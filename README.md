# 📍 Mobile Next Roadmap Repo

Welcome to the official Mobile Next Roadmap 

This repo provides a transparent view into what we are building, improving, and planning for Mobile MCP.
You can see it in the connected Projects views.
Our mission is to deliver the most scalable, flexible, and developer-friendly mobile automation platform, compatible across iOS, Android, Simulators, Emulators, and physical devices.

We continuously update this roadmap based on:
- Community feedback
- Industry trends in mobile automation and LLM-driven interaction
- Internal research and feature prioritization

## 🗺️ Roadmap Structure

We organize our roadmap using a **Now / Next / Later** framework:
- **Now**: What we are actively working on.
- **Next**: What we plan to build immediately after current priorities.
- **Later**: Longer-term ideas, explorations, and larger initiatives we intend to pursue.

This approach ensures transparency and allows the community to understand both near-term focus and long-term vision.
